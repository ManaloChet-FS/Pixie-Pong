# Pixie Pong Assignment

A ball that won't stop bouncing until it hits all four borders of the canvas.

I've created a config where you can adjust the following:
- canvas width
- canvas height
- ball size
- border size

I implemented all three of the extra requirements of:
- Pixel-Perfect Hit detection
- Border color change
- Random circle movement
